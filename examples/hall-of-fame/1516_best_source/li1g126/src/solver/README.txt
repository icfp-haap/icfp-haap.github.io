To solve your level just run:

    > ./solver < path/to/file

Example:

    > ./solver < tab1.in

Three levels are included to test.

Levels with a high degree of complexity or big in their
size will take much time to run. This because the code 
was not optimized for this effect. This is just a simple
proof of concept, with no intentions to being efficient.
